| LP4 | Customer Churn on Gradio | https://medium.com/@oparetwumseth/empowering-data-driven-decision-making-with-gradio-a-case-study-on-customer-attrition-3d886f49468e  |  |

## Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>
   
In our relentless pursuit of precision in predicting customer attrition for a leading telecommunications company, we've harnessed the formidable capabilities of Gradioâ€”a state-of-the-art Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive user interfaces for machine learning models. With Gradio, the process of crafting web-based interfaces for machine learning models becomes effortless, ushering in a new era of user-friendly data science. 

## Objectives of Project <a name="objectives-of-project"></a>
1. Building customizable Graphic User Interface components with Gradio.
2. Deploying Machine Learning models to Gradio App for real-time prediction.. 

## Goal of Project <a name="goal-of-project"></a>
To deploy the machine learning model that was trained in a previous project. In that project we analyzed customer churn rate and built classification models to perform churn analysis on a telecommunication company's customers. This project gives users the chance to interact with the model by inputing variables for the model to predict if customer will churn or not. 

## Input Variables <a name="Input"></a>
The input variable for this application are:
* If user is a Senior Citizen
* If user has a partner or not
* if user has dependents or not
* The length of tenure
* Is there a phone service
* Does the user have multiple lines
* Monthly charges
* Total Charges
* Gender of user
* Internet service
* streaming tv
* streaming movies
* contract
* Type of billing
* the payment method

## Installation: <a name="installation:"></a>
* Gradio 
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Joblib
* scikit-learn
* RandomForestClassifier
